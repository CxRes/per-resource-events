## Document Conventions ## {#document-conventions}

All of the text of this specification is normative except assertions, diagrams, examples, notes and sections explicitly marked as non-normative as described in [[!RFC2119]].

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) [[!RFC2119]] [[!RFC8174]] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

The above-mentioned key words are used exclusively in the normative parts of this document and appear only in all capitals.

## Conformant Algorithms ## {#conformant-algorithms}

Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.

Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps can be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. In particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be easy to understand and are not intended to be performant. Implementers are encouraged to optimize.

## Compliance with Other Specifications ## {#compliance-with-other-specifications}

In general, specifications interact with and rely on a wide variety of other specifications. In certain circumstances, unfortunately, conflicting needs require a specification to violate the requirements of other specifications. This specification denotes such transgressions as a **wilful violation** and records the reason for that violation. Other specifications that rely on this specification SHOULD do the same.

## Specification Category ## {#specification-category}

The [PROTOCOL] identifies the following [Specification Category](https://www.w3.org/TR/spec-variability/#spec-cat) to distinguish the types of conformance:
+ API,
+ Notation/syntax,
+ Set of events,
+ Protocol.
