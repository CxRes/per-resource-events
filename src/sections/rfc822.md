  Appendix A: Additional Semantics for `message/rfc822`
</h2>

The `multipart/digest` multipart media-type ([[!RFC2046]] [[RFC2046#section-5.1.5|§ 5.1.5 Digest Subtype]]) uses `message/rfc822` media-type ([[!RFC2046]] [[RFC2046#section-5.2.1|§ 5.2.1 RFC822 Subtype]], [[!RFC822]]) for body parts as default. It follows that the [PROTOCOL] transmits notifications as `message/rfc822`, unless the [=application client=] requests otherwise.

## Request ## {#rfc822-request}

An [=application clients=] MAY specify additional parameters to `message/rfc822` notification media-type in the `accept` [=event field=] associated with the `PREP` list item in the [:accept-events:] header field of the request.

## Generation ## {#rfc822-generation}

A [=resource server=] implementing the [PROTOCOL] SHOULD send a notification to an [=application client=] when a request with one of the following methods on a resource:

+ `POST` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-9.3.3|§ 9.3.3 POST]]),
+ `PUT` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-9.3.4|§ 9.3.4 PUT]]),
+ `PATCH` ([[!RFC5789]]),
+ `DELETE` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-9.3.5|§.3.5 DELETE]]).

generates one of the following status codes:

+ `200 (OK)` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-15.3.1|§ 15.3.1 200 OK]])
+ `201 (Created)` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-15.3.2|§ 15.3.2 201 Created]]):
+ `204 (No Content)` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-15.3.5|§ 15.3.5 204 No Content]])

The notification MUST NOT be sent before the success response has been sent to the user agent that initiated the request.

## Headers ## {#rfc822-headers}

A [=resource server=] MUST include the following header fields in a `message/rfc822` formatted [PREP] notification:

: `Method`
:: identical to `:method` pseudo-header field in a HTTP/2 request ([[!RFC9113]] [[RFC9113#section-8.3.1|§ 8.3.1 Request Pseudo-Header Fields]]), that specifies the request method that triggered the notification.
: `Date`
:: identical to `Date` header field in a HTTP response ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-6.6.1|§ 6.6.1 Date]]), that specifies date and time at which the event that triggered the notification was completed.
: `Event-ID`
:: an opaque identifier for the generated notification.

  <div class="issue">

    Do we need to make this identical to one of the following:

    + `Message-ID` ([[RFC5322#section-3.6.4]]),
    + `id` ([[EVENTSOURCE#section-9.2.6]]).

  </div>

A [=resource server=] SHOULD include the following headers in a `message/rfc822` formatted [PREP] notification when the state of the resource or its representation is modified as a result of the event:

: `ETag`
:: identical to `ETag` header field ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-8.8.3|§ 8.8.3 ETag]]) in a HTTP response, that is an opaque identifier for the current representation of the state of the resource.

<div class="example">

<cite>`PUT` notification message

```http

Method: PUT
Date: Sat, 1 April 2023 10:11:12 GMT
Event-ID: 1234
ETag: "abc123"
--random-boundary
```

</div>

A [=resource server=] MUST include the following headers in a `message/rfc822` formatted [PREP] notification when sent as a result of a `POST` request:

: `Content-Location`
:: identical to the `Content-Location` header field ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-8.7|§ 8.7 Content-Location]]) when

<div class="example">

<cite>`POST` notification message:</cite>

```http

Method: POST
Date: Sat, 1 April 2023 10:12:14 GMT
Event-ID: 1235
Content-Location: /foo
--random-boundary
```

</div>

## Body ## {#rfc822-body}

The body of a `message/rfc822` formatted [PREP] notification might be used to provide a <dfn>delta representation</dfn>, the difference between the state of the representation before and after the most recent event on the resource.

If the [=application client=] does not specify <dfn data-dfn-type="http-header">delta</dfn> parameter associated with a preferred notifications format of `message/rfc822` in the `accept` [=event field=] of the [[#request]] that results in `message/rfc822` formatted [PREP] notifications, the notifications MUST NOT contain a body.

If the [=application client=] specifies a ([:delta:]) parameter associated with a preferred notifications format of `message/rfc822` in the `accept` [=event field=] of the [[#request]] that results in `message/rfc822` formatted [PREP] notifications, a [=resource server=] SHOULD send the [=delta representation=] as the body of the notification when a request with one of the following methods on a resource:

+ `POST` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-9.3.3|§ 9.3.3 POST]]),
+ `PUT` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-9.3.4|§ 9.3.4 PUT]]),
+ `PATCH` ([[!RFC5789]]),

generate one of the following status codes:

+ `200 (OK)` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-15.3.1|§ 15.3.1 200 OK]]),
+ `201 (Created)` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-15.3.2|§ 15.3.2 201 Created]]),
+ `204 (No Content)` ([[!RFC9110]] [[RFC9110#section-15.3.5|§ 15.3.5 204 No Content]]).

A [=resource server=] SHOULD send the [=delta representation=] in the content-type preferred by the client as specified by the [:delta:] parameter.

<!--
  If a `delta` parameter is not set in the `content-type` event field for the [[#notifications-response]], [=resource servers=] MUST provide a `Content-Type` header in each notification.
-->

<div class="example">

<cite>`PATCH` notification with delta representation:</cite>

```http
--random-boundary  <- From the Previous Message
                   <- Empty part response headers & a blank line
Method: PATCH
Date: Sat, 1 April 2023 10:14:16 GMT
Event-ID: 1236
ETag: "xyz987"
Content-type: application/example
